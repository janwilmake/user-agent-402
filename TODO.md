# General improvements

- ✅ We want to be able to retrieve additional configuration for paying users and put that into any desired storage, easily. Ensure to pass `ctx.session`
- ✅ Allow `X-Price` header response for dynamic pricing overwrite.
- ✅ Allow refreshing cache in `waitUntil` if cache was hit, using `shouldRefresh` handler. however, be sure that this only happens if a user can be charged.
- ✅ Work on easy type-safety.
- We want to be able to charge any user by ID in non-fetch-requests as well e.g. for queued jobs and cron jobs. Ensure we overwrite all handlers to pass an additional function `ctx.charge(userId,amountCents,allowNegativeBalance)`

LETS DO THIS TODAY and generate a rewrite of `googllm` with this one as middleware. Should be much simpler now! Then, after it supports html as well, make a thread on it; **Key differentiator: Google without ads and tracking**

# Abstract Away Secret Management for Stripe Integration

The current solution allows you to fully control all secrets and configuration in wrangler and do your own deployment. However, what if stripe was a managed resource that got created and configured? We can even go further and remove the need for `wrangler.toml` altogether if we also provision a queue and schedule based on exported config. This does create some complications though, so is it possible to just manage stripe via a cli (as in-between step)?

Ideally we just want to setup a worker like this:

- `STRIPE_SECRET`: known after stripe oauth
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: known after stripe oauth
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`: find or create with name `wrangler.name`, stripeflare version, and callback `https://{routes[0].pattern}/stripe-webhook`
- `STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`: find or create with name `wrangler.name` and price from `export default` or default

This CLI should create the secrets in Cloudflare or in `.dev.vars` if `--local` is passed.

Maybe I can use Sam Goodwin's Alchemy SDK to easily build on stripe and get this done?

The CLI would need Stripe OAuth + Prompt for a Cloudflare API Key.

This would make making monetized agent-friendly workers super simple!
